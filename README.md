# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project


###DESCRIPTION

This repo contains information, data, and code for the final project for the course "Getting and Cleaning Data" on Coursera. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The data represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

The R script called "run_analysis.R"  does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The code book in this repo ("CodeBook.md") describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.
